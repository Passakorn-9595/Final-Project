### Welcome to the Final Project Showcase!
This web application demonstrates the end-to-end data science process on two distinct datasets.
            
We have developed two models:
1. **Machine Learning Ensemble Model**: A voting classifier combining Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression on the **Bank Marketing Dataset**.
2. **Neural Network**: A custom feed-forward neural network predicting housing prices on the **California Housing Dataset**.

Please use the sidebar to navigate to the detailed explanation and interactive testing pages for both models.
